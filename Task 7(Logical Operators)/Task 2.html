Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90 inclusively.

Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one â€“ without it.

<script>
let age;
age = 15;
if (!(age >= 14 && age <= 90)) {
    alert("not between!")
}

if (age < 14 || age > 90){
    alert("not between!")
}
</script>
